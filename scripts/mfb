# mfb - matteframe shell script
# A script to create a matte frame around a picture that will convert the picture to a 1:1 aspect ratio by adding a padding of a certain color (default: white) around it

# This is a rewrite of the python version of this script. It is better to have no dependencies on the script, that to hope that everyone wanting to use this script has Python2 installed.

# Usage:
# - matteframe <imgfile> <coefficient> <color>


# Checking if the ImageMagick is installed on the computer
command -v convert > /dev/null;
! [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "Imagemagick is not installed";

# Defining functions
testFileExists () {
	! [ -a "$1" ] && ( echo "File not found"; exit 1 );
}

testForNumber () {
	# https://stackoverflow.com/a/3951175
	if ! [ "$1" -eq "$1" ] 2>/dev/null; then
		echo '"'"$1"'"' is not a valid coefficient number.
		exit 1;
	fi
}

# defining default variables
coefficient=12
color='white'
